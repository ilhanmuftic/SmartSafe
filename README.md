# ESP32 Keypad-Controlled Lock with OLED Display and Web PIN Management

This project implements a secure keypad-based lock system using an ESP32, OLED display, servo motor, and a web interface to remotely manage the PIN code.

## Features

- 4x4 Matrix Keypad for PIN entry
- OLED Display (SSD1306) shows prompts and status messages
- Servo Motor controls a lock mechanism (locked/unlocked positions)
- EEPROM Emulation on ESP32 flash to securely store a 4-digit PIN
- WiFi-enabled Web Server allows remote PIN change via a simple web form
- PIN Validation on keypad entry with feedback on OLED and serial monitor
- Default PIN is set to `1234` if none is stored

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad
- OLED Display (SSD1306, I2C)
- Servo motor (e.g., SG90) connected to GPIO 15
- Power supply and wiring as needed

## Wiring Summary

| Component       | ESP32 Pin         |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Keypad Rows     | 32, 33, 25, 26    |
| Keypad Columns  | 27, 14, 12, 13    |
| OLED SDA        | GPIO 21 (I2C SDA) |
| OLED SCL        | GPIO 22 (I2C SCL) |
| Servo Signal    | GPIO 15           |
| 5V and GND      | As required       |

*Adjust pins as needed to fit your hardware.*

## Software Setup

1. Install the following Arduino libraries:
   - Keypad
   - Adafruit SSD1306
   - Adafruit GFX
   - ESP32Servo
   - WiFi
   - WebServer
   - EEPROM (built-in for ESP32)

2. Replace the WiFi credentials (`ssid` and `password`) in the code with your own.

3. Upload the code to your ESP32 board.

## Usage

- On startup, the OLED displays: **Enter PIN:**
- Use the keypad to enter the 4-digit PIN.
- If correct, the servo unlocks for 3 seconds and then locks again.
- If incorrect, **Wrong PIN** is displayed for 3 seconds.
- Press `*` to clear the current input.
- Press `D` to manually reset/lock the servo.
- Connect to the ESP32‚Äôs IP address shown in Serial Monitor.
- Access `http://<ESP32_IP>/` in a browser to view or change the PIN remotely.

## üîå ESP Device Integration Guide

### Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 or ESP8266 microcontroller
- Digital lock mechanism (servo/solenoid)
- WiFi connectivity
- Optional: OLED display for status

### ESP Code Structure
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <HTTPClient.h>

// Validate PIN with server
bool validatePIN(String pin) {
  // POST request to /api/access-logs
  // Return true if valid, false if invalid/used
}

// Unlock mechanism
void unlockSafe() {
  // Control servo/solenoid
  // Log access event
}
```

### Integration Steps
1. Connect ESP to company WiFi
2. Configure API endpoint URLs
3. Implement PIN validation logic
4. Add physical lock control
5. Test with approved request codes

## üìû Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Access logs for security auditing
- Error tracking and notifications
- Performance metrics and alerts
- Database backup verification

### Common Issues
- **PIN Not Working**: Check if code was already used (one-time only)
- **Access Denied**: Verify employee has approved request
- **ESP Offline**: Check WiFi connection and power supply
- **Database Errors**: Verify connection string and credentials
